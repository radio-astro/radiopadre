Functions and helpers for displaying FITS images etc. in an ipython notebook.


Usage
-----

```
$ apt-get install imagemagick
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
$ export PYTHONPATH=PYTHONPATH:/home/USER/radioradiopadre  # or wherever you've cloned the repo
$ ipython notebook
```

Browse to http://localhost:8888, or whatever port your ipython notebooksays it binds to. Go into the 
notebooks folder and open the example notebook.

Using with your own data
------------------------

Copy example.ipynb or view-everything.ipynb into your data directory, and start ipython notebook there. You will probably want to customize it for your data. Refer to extended-example.ipynb, and to the other notebooks in the repo for inspiration.

Using with docker
-----------------

If you can't do the pip install above for whatever reason, you can use radioradiopadre with the radioastro/notebook docker container. Use the ```run-radioradiopadre-docker.sh``` script to run it with docker.
